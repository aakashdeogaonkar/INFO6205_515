INFO6205 GA Project
Robotic Controller Maze Navigation Using Genetic Algorithms
The intuition behind this project is to use Genetic Algorithm to design a robotic controller, that uses sensors to navigate through a maze. The robot can take four actions: move one-step forward, turn left, turn right, or, rarely, do nothing.The robot has six sensors: three on the front, one on the left, one on the right and one on the back.
